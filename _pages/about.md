Hello! I am a double-degree MSc student in Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Robots at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Aalto University.
My research spans reinforcement learning, robot learning, and representation learning.
My long-term goal is to build intelligent systems that can understand the world, interact with it physically, and continuously learn from those interactions.
Ultimately, I aim to develop embodied agents that can free humans from repetitive and mundane tasks.

Currently, I am working on dexterous hand manipulation using vision-language-action (VLA) models at the  [RPL Lab, KTH](https://www.kth.se/rpl).
Previously, I interned at Astribot as a Robotic Learning Algorithm Researcher, where I explored integrating long-horizon memory into imitation learning and investigated slot-based, object-centric robotic manipulation.
At Aalto University, I focus on object-centric learning, supervised by Prof. Joni Pajarinen.

In parallel, I am also building an entrepreneurial team aiming to combine cutting-edge algorithms with cloud computing platforms to tackle the data scarcity problem in embodied intelligence.
Our project is still in an early stage—if you are interested in what we are developing, feel free to reach out at [hongjia.liu@aalto.fi](mailto:hongjia.liu@aalto.fi).

We are currently looking for hardware engineers (AR/VR focus) and researchers specializing in generative models and robotic learning algorithms.
